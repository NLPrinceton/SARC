DESCRIPTION

This section of the WordNet Reference Manual contains manual pages that
describe the formats of the various files included in different WordNet 1.6
packages.

NOMENCLATURE

All files are in ASCII. Fields are generally separated by one space, unless
otherwise noted, and each line is terminated with a newline character. In
the file format descriptions, terms in italics refer to field names.
Characters or strings in boldface represent an actual character or string as
it appears in the file. Items enclosed in italicized square brackets ([ ] )
may not be present. Since several files contain fields that have the
identical meaning, field names are consistently defined. For example,
several WordNet files contain one or more synset_offset fields. In each
case, the definition of synset_offset is identical.
