NAME

List of WordNet lexicographer file names and numbers

DESCRIPTION

During WordNet development synsets are organized into forty-five
lexicographer files based on syntactic category and logical groupings.
grind(1WN) processes these files and produces a database suitable for use
with the WordNet library, interface code, and other applications. The format
of the lexicographer files is described in wninput(5WN) .

A file number corresponds to each lexicographer file. File numbers are
encoded in several parts of the WordNet system as an efficient way to
indicate a lexicographer file name. The file lexnames lists the mapping
between file names and numbers, and can be used by programs or end users to
correlate the two.

File Format

Each line in lexnames contains 3 tab separated fields, and is terminated
with a newline character. The first field is the two digit decimal integer
file number. (The first file in the list is numbered 00 .) The second field
is the name of the lexicographer file that is represented by that number,
and the third field is an integer that indicates the syntactic category of
the synsets contained in the file. This is simply a shortcut for programs
and scripts, since the syntactic category is also part of the lexicographer
file's name.

Syntactic Category

The syntactic category field is encoded as follows:

     1    NOUN
     2    VERB
     3    ADJECTIVE
     4    ADVERB
