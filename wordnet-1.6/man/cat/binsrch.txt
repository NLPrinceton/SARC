NAME

bin_search, copyfile, replace_line, insert_line

SYNOPSIS

char *bin_search(char *key, FILE *fp);

void copyfile(FILE *fromfp, FILE *tofp);

char *replace_line(char *new_line, char *key, FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION

The WordNet library contains several general purpose functions for
performing a binary search and modifying sorted files.

bin_search() is the primary binary search algorithm to search for key as the
first item on a line in the file pointed to by fp . The delimiter between
the key and the rest of the fields on the line, if any, must be a space. A
pointer to a static variable containing the entire line is returned. NULL is
returned if a match is not found.

The remaining functions are not used by WordNet, and are only briefly
described.

copyfile() copies the contents of one file to another.

replace_line() replaces a line in a file having searchkey key with the
contents of new_line . It returns the original line or NULL in case of
error.

insert_line() finds the proper place to insert the contents of new_line ,
having searchkey key in the sorted file pointed to by fp . It returns NULL
if a line with this searchkey is already in the file.

NOTES

The maximum length of key is 1024.

The maximum line length in a file is 25K for Unix platforms, and 8K for the
PC and Macintosh platforms.

If there are no additional fields after the search key, the key must be
followed by at least one space before the newline character.

WARNINGS

binsearch() returns a pointer to a static character buffer. The returned
string should be copied by the caller if the results need to be saved, as a
subsequent call will replace the contents of the static buffer.
