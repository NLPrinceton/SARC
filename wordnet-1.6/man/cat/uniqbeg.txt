NAME

uniqbeg - unique beginners for noun hierarchies

DESCRIPTION

All of the WordNet noun synsets are organized into hierarchies. Each synset
is part of at least one hierarchy, headed by a synset called a unique
beginner. All of these synsets originate in the lexicographer file noun.Tops
. From any noun synset, except a unique beginner, the hypernym pointers can
be traced up to one of the following synsets:

     { entity, something, (anything having existence (living or
     nonliving)) }

     { psychological_feature, (a feature of the mental life of a living
     organism) }

     { abstraction, (a general concept formed by extracting common
     features from specific examples) }

     { state, (the way something is with respect to its main
     attributes; "the current state of knowledge";
        "his state of health"; "in a weak financial state") }

     { event, (something that happens at a given place and time) }

     { act, human_action, human_activity, (something that people do or
     cause to happen) }

     { group, grouping, (any number of entities (members) considered as
     a unit) }

     { possession, (anything owned or possessed) }

     { phenomenon, (any state or process known through the senses
     rather than by intuition or reasoning) }

NOTES

The lexicographer files are not included in the WordNet package.
