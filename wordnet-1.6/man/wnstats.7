.SH NOTES
Statistics for all types of adjectives and adjective satellites are
combined.  

The total of all unique noun, verb, adjective, and adverb strings is
greater than 121962.  However, many strings are unique within a
syntactic category, but are in more than one syntactic category.  The
figure in the table represents the unique strings when all syntactic
categories are combined.
