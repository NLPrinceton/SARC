.SH NAME
wn \- command line interface to WordNet lexical database  
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwn\fP [ \fIsearchstr\fP ] [ \fB\-h\fP] [ \fB\-g\fP ] [ \fB\-a\fP ] [ \fB\-l\fP ] [ \fB\-o\fP ] [ \fB\-s\fP ] [ \fP\-n\fI#\fR ] [ \fIsearch_option\fP... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwn(\|)\fP provides a command line interface to the WordNet
database, allowing synsets and relations to be displayed as formatted
text.  For each word, different searches are provided, based on
syntactic category and pointer types.  Although only base forms of
words are usually stored in WordNet, users may search for inflected
forms.  A morphological process is applied to the search string to
generate a form that is present in WordNet.

The command line interface is often useful when writing scripts to
extract information from the WordNet database.  Simple post-processing
of the output can reformat the results as desired.  For example, the
command line interface is called by Princeton's World Wide Web Wordnet
interface.

.SS Search Options
Note that the last letter of \fIsearch_option\fP generally denotes the
part of speech that the search applies to: \fBn\fP for nouns, \fBv\fP
for verbs, \fBa\fP for adjectives, and \fBr\fP for adverbs.  Multiple
searches may be done for \fIsearchstr\fP with a single command by
specifying all the appropriate search options.

.TP 15
\fB\-syns\fP(\fIn\fP | \fIv\fP | \fIa\fP | \fIr\fP) 
Display synonyms
and immediate hypernyms of synsets containing \fIsearchstr\fP.
Synsets are ordered by frequency of use.  For adjectives, if
\fIsearchstr\fP is in a head synset, the cluster's satellite synsets
are displayed in place of hypernyms.  If \fIsearchstr\fP is in a
satellite synset, its head synset is also displayed.
.TP 15
\fB\-sims\fP(\fIn\fP | \fIv\fP) 
Display noun or verb synonyms and
immediate hypernyms of synsets containing \fIsearchstr\fP.  Synsets
are grouped by similarity of meaning.
.TP 15
\fB\-ants\fP(\fIn\fP | \fIv\fP | \fIa\fP | \fIr\fP)
Display synsets containing antonyms of \fIsearchstr\fP.
For adjectives, if \fIsearchstr\fP is
in a head synset, \fIsearchstr\fP has a direct antonym.
The head synset for the direct antonym is displayed along
with the direct antonym's satellite synsets.  If \fIsearchstr\fP is in a
satellite synset, \fIsearchstr\fP has an indirect antonym via the
head synset, which is displayed.

.TP 15
\fB\-hypo\fP(\fIn\fP | \fIv\fP)
Display immediate hyponyms (subordinates) for \fIsearchstr\fP

.SH SEARCH RESULTS
The results of a search are written to the standard output.  For each
search, the output consists a one line description of the search,
followed by the search results.

All searches other than \fB\-over\fP list all senses matching the
search results in the following general format.  Items enclosed in
italicized square brackets (\fI[~...~]\fP) may not be present.

.RS
One line listing the number of senses matching the search request.

Each sense matching the search requested displayed as follows:
.nf
	\fBSense \fIn\fR
	\fI[\fB{\fIsynset_offset\fB}\fI] [\fB<\fIlex_filename\fB>\fI]~~word1[\fB#\fIsense_number][,~~word2...]\fR
.fi

Where \fIn\fP is the sense number of the search word,
\fIsynset_offset\fP is the byte offset of the synset in the
\fBdata.\fIpos\fR file corresponding to the syntactic category,
\fIlex_filename\fP is the name of the lexicographer file that the
synset comes from, \fIword1\fP is the first word in the synset (note
that this is not necessarily the search word) and \fIsense_number\fP
is the WordNet sense number assigned to the preceding word.
\fIsynset_offset\fP, \fIlex_filename\fP, and \fIsense_number\fP are
generated when the \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-a\fP, and \fB\-s\fP options,
respectively, are specified.

The synsets matching the search requested are printed below each sense's
synset output described above.  Each line of output is preceded by a
marker (usually \fB=>\fP), then a synset, formatted as described
above.  If a search traverses more one level of the tree, then
successive lines are indented by spaces corresponding to its level in
the hierarchy.  When the \fB\-g\fP option is specified, synset glosses
are displayed in parentheses at the end of each synset.  Each synset
is printed on one line.

Senses are generally ordered from most to least frequently used, with
the most common sense numbered \fB1\fP.  Frequency of use is
determined by the number of times a sense is tagged in the various
semantic concordance texts.  Senses that are not semantically tagged
follow the ordered senses.

Noun and verb senses can be grouped by similarity of meaning, rather
than ordered by frequency of use.  The \fB\-sims\fP search prints all
senses that are close in meaning together, with a line of dashes
indicating the end of a group.  See
.BR wngroups (7WN)
for a discussion of how senses are grouped.

The \fB\-over\fP search displays an overview of all the senses of the
search word in all syntactic categories.  The results of this search
are similar to the \fB\-syns\fP search, however no additional
(ex. hypernym) synsets are displayed, and synset glosses are always
printed.  The senses are grouped by syntactic category, and each
synset is annotated as described above with \fIsynset_offset\fP,
\fIlex_filename\fP, and \fIsense_number\fP as dictated by the
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-a\fP, and \fB\-s\fP options.  The overview search also
indicates how many of the senses in each syntactic category are
represented in the tagged texts.  This is a way for the user to
determine whether a sense's sense number is based on semantic tagging
data, or was randomly assigned.

If a search cannot be performed on some senses of \fIsearchstr\fP, the
search results are headed by a string of the form:
.nf
	X of Y senses of \fIsearchstr\fP
.fi

When \fB\-framv\fP is specified, sample illustrative sentences and
generic sentence frames are displayed.  If a sample sentence is found,
the base form of \fIsearch\fP is substituted into the sentence, and it
is printed below the synset, preceded with the \fBEX:\fP marker.  When
no sample sentences are found, the generic sentence frames are
displayed.  Sentence frames that are acceptable for all words in a
synset are preceded by the marker \fB*>\fP.  If a frame is acceptable
for the search word only, it is preceded by the marker \fB=>\fP.

Search results for adjectives are slightly different from those for
other parts of speech.  When an adjective is printed, its direct
antonym, if it has one, is also printed in parentheses.  When
\fIsearchstr\fP is in a head synset, all of the head synset's
satellites are also displayed.  The position of an adjective in
relation to the noun may be restricted to the \fIprenominal\fP,
\fIpostnominal\fP or \fIpredicative\fP position.  Where present, these
restrictions are noted in parentheses.

When an adjective is a participle of a verb, the output indicates the
verb and displays its synset.

When an adverb is derived from an adjective, the specific adjectival
sense on which it is based is indicated.

The morphological transformations performed by the search code may
result in more than one word to search for.  WordNet automatically
performs the requested search on all of the strings and returns the
results grouped by word.  For example, the verb \fBsaw\fP is both the
present tense of \fBsaw\fP and the past tense of \fBsee\fP.  When
passed \fIsearchstr\fP \fBsaw\fP, WordNet performs the desired search
first on \fBsaw\fP and next on \fBsee\fP, returning the list of
\fBsaw\fP senses and search results, followed by those for \fBsee\fP.
.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBwn(\|)\fP normally exits with the number of senses displayed.  If
\fIsearchword\fP is not found in WordNet, it exits with \fB0\fP.

If the WordNet database cannot be opened, an error messages is
displyed and \fBwn(\|)\fP exits with \fB-1\fP.
