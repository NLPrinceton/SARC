.SH NAME
cntlist \- file listing number of times each tagged sense occurs in a
semantic concordance
.SH DESCRIPTION
A cntlist file for a semantic concordance lists the number of times
each semantically tagged sense occurs in the concordance and its
sense number in the WordNet database.  Each line in the file
corresponds to a sense in the WordNet database to which at least one
semantic tag points.  Only senses that are tagged in a concordance are
in the concordance's cntlist file.  See 
.BR semcor (7WN)
for information about semantic concordances and a list of those
included in this release.

A file, \fBcntlist\fP, is provided with each semantic concordance for
informational and statistical purposes only.  The files are not used
by any software provided with the WordNet or semantic concordance
packages.  A cntlist file is generated by counting the number of
\fIsent_num,word_num\fP pairs in all \fIlocation_list\fPs for each
\fIsense_key\fP in a 
.BR taglist (5WN)
file.  The data is sorted in descending
numerical order, and the resulting file ranks the senses from most to
least frequently tagged in the semantic concordance.
.SS WordNet Database \fIcntlist\fP File
In the WordNet database, words are assigned sense numbers based on
frequency of use in the semantic concordances.  The cntlist file used
by
.BR grind (1WN) 
to build the WordNet database and assign the sense numbers is a union
of the cntlist files from the various semantic concordances.  This
combined cntlist file is provided with the WordNet package and is
found in the \fBWNSEARCHDIR\fP directory.
.SS File Format
Each line in a cntlist file contains information for one sense.  The
file is ordered from most to least frequently tagged sense.  The
fields are separated by one space, and each line is terminated with a
newline character.  Senses having the same \fItag_cnt\fP value are
listed in reverse alphabetical order of the \fIlemma\fP field of the
\fIsense_key\fP.

Each line in \fBcntlist\fP is of the form:

.RS
\fItag_cnt~~sense_key~~sense_number\fP
.RE

where \fItag_cnt\fP is the decimal number of times the sense is tagged
in the corresponding semantic concordance.  \fIsense_key\fP is a
WordNet sense encoding and \fIsense_number\fP is a WordNet sense
number as described in
.BR senseidx (5WN).
