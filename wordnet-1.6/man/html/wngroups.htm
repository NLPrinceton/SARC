wngroups - discussion of WordNet search code to group similar senses 
 
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
Standard dictionaries commonly group related senses of a 
word with expressions such as "the act, process, or result of X", or else 
they enter the act, process, and result senses as subheads under a single 
sense number. Unlike standard dictionaries, the default display for the 
WordNet browser is to show senses in order of frequency of use in the 
semantically tagged texts described in <B><A HREF="semcor.htm">semcor</B>(7WN)</A>
. The  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>RELATIVES </B></FONT>
  search 
displays similar senses of a word together.  At the present time, nouns 
and some verbs are grouped.  
<H3><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Noun Groups </A></H3>
Three relations are used to group 
noun senses: cousins, sisters, and twins. <P>
 The cousin groupings exploit 
the hyponym relation in WordNet.  Many WordNet nodes whose hyponyms bear 
a specific relation to each other have been identified.  For example, the 
noun <B>crab </B> refers to an animal, as well as the edible meat of the animal. 
 The same relation, that of "an animal and its edible meat", holds for 
<B>lobster </B>, <B>chicken </B> and most other matching strings under the <I>food </I> and 
<I>animal </I> nodes. <P>
 Another class of related senses in the noun hierarchy is 
called sisters.  Sisters are matching strings that are both the immediate 
hyponyms of the same superordinate.  For example, the noun <B>flounder </B> can 
refer to several kinds of <B>flatfish </B>. <P>
 The third grouping relation is called 
twins. These are synsets that have at least three words in common.  For 
example, one sense of <B>duo </B> is a musical group and another is a musical 
composition. Both synsets contain <B>duet </B>, <B>duette </B>, and <B>duo </B>. <P>
 Transitivity 
is used to combine groups of overlapping senses into the largest sense 
groups possible.  
<H3><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3">Verb Groups </A></H3>
Some similar senses of verbs have been grouped 
by the lexicographers. This grouping is done statically in the lexicographer 
source files using the semantic <I>pointer_symbol </I> <B>$ </B>.  As with the noun senses, 
transitivity is used to combine groups of overlapping senses into the 
largest sense groups possible.  
<H3><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">Exception List </A></H3>
There are, of course, exceptions 
to all of the relations. For example, the noun <B>coral </B> is in both the animal 
and food hierarchies, but does not bear the relation of "an animal and 
its edible meat". Candidates for cousin and twin groupings are checked 
by hand and those that should not be grouped together are listed in the 
exception list file.  
<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5">NOTES </A></H2>
Coverage of noun cousins is incomplete.   <P>
 Coverage 
of verb groups is incomplete. <P>
 Groups of noun senses are determined at 
run-time - not statically - when the <FONT SIZE=-1><B>RELATIVES </B></FONT>
  search is requested.  Depending 
on the computer platform and the number of senses involved, this search 
may run slowly.
