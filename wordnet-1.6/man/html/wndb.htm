<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
For each 
syntactic category, two files are needed to represent the contents of 
the WordNet database - <B>index. </B><I>pos </I> and <B>data. </B><I>pos </I>, where <I>pos </I> is <B>noun </B>, <B>verb 
</B>, <B>adj </B> and <B>adv </B>.  The other auxiliary files are used by the WordNet library's 
searching functions and are needed to run the various WordNet browsers. 
<P>
 Each index file is an alphabetized list of all the words found in WordNet 
in the corresponding part of speech.  On each line, following the word, 
is a list of byte offsets (<I>synset_offset </I>s) in the corresponding data 
file, one for each synset containing the word. Words in the index file 
are in lower case only, regardless of how they were entered in the lexicographer 
files.  This folds various orthographic representations of the word into 
one line enabling database searches to be case insensitive.  See <B><A HREF="wninput.htm">wninput</B>(5WN)</A>
 
for a detailed description of the lexicographer files <P>
 A data file for 
a syntactic category contains information corresponding to the synsets 
that were specified in the lexicographer files, with relational pointers 
resolved to <I>synset_offset </I>s. Each line corresponds to a synset.  Pointers 
are followed and hierarchies traversed by moving from one synset to another 
via the <I>synset_offset </I>s.   <P>
 The exception list files, <I>pos </I><B>.exc </B>, are used 
to help the morphological processor find base forms from irregular inflections. 
<P>
 The files <B>cousin.tops </B> and <B>cousin.exc </B> are used by the searching software 
to group similar senses of a word together when displayed. <P>
 The files <B>sentidx.vrb 
</B> and <B>sents.vrb </B> contain sentences illustrating the use of specific senses 
of some verbs.  These files are used by the searching software in response 
to a request for verb sentence frames.  Generic sentence frames are displayed 
when an illustrative sentence is not present. <P>
 The various database files 
are in ASCII formats that are easily read by both humans and machines. 
 All fields, unless otherwise noted, are separated by one space character, 
and all lines are terminated by a newline character.  Fields enclosed in 
italicized square brackets may not be present. <P>
 See  <B><A HREF="wngloss.htm">wngloss</B>(7WN)</A>
 for a 
glossary of WordNet terminology and a discussion of the database's content 
and logical organization.  
<H3><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2">Index File Format </A></H3>
Each index file begins with 
several lines containing a copyright notice, version number and license 
agreement.  These lines all begin with two spaces and the line number so 
they do not interfere with the binary search algorithm that is used to 
look up entries in the index files.  All other lines are in the following 
format.  In the field descriptions, <B>number </B> always refers to a decimal 
integer unless otherwise defined. <P>

<DL>

<DT><I>poly_cnt</I>  </DT>
<DD>Number 
of different senses (polysemy) <I>lemma </I> has in WordNet.  Note that this is 
the same value as <I>sense_cnt </I>, but is retained for historical reasons. </DD>

<DT><I>p_cnt</I> 
 </DT>
<DD>Number of different types of pointers <I>lemma </I> has in all synsets containing 
it. </DD>

<DT><I>ptr_symbol</I>  </DT>
<DD>A space separated list of <I>p_cnt </I> different types of pointers 
that <I>lemma </I> has in all synsets containing it. See <B><A HREF="wninput.htm">wninput</B>(5WN)</A>
 for a list

<DT><I>sense_cnt</I>  </DT>
<DD>Number of synsets that <I>lemma </I> is 
in.  This is the number of senses of the word in WordNet. See  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>Sense Numbers

<DD>Byte offset in <B>data.<I>pos </I></B> file of a synset 
containing <I>lemma </I>.  Each <I>synset_offset </I> in the list corresponds to a different 
sense of <I>lemma </I> in WordNet.  <I>synset_offset </I> is an 8 digit, zero-filled decimal 
integer that can be used with <B><A HREF="fseek.htm">fseek</B>(3)</A>
 to read a synset from the data 
file.  When passed to <B><A HREF="read_synset.htm">read_synset</B>(3WN)</A>

<DL>

<DT><I>w_cnt</I>  </DT>
<DD>Two digit hexadecimal integer 
indicating the number of words in the synset. </DD>

<DT><I>word</I>  </DT>
<DD>ASCII form of a word 
as entered in the synset by the lexicographer, with spaces replaced by 
underscore characters (<B>_ </B>).  The text of the word is case sensitive, in 
contrast to its form in the corresponding <B>index. </B><I>pos </I> file, that contains 
only lower-case forms.  In <B>data.adj </B>, a <I>word </I> is followed by a syntactic 
marker if one was specified in the lexicographer file.  A syntactic marker 
is appended, in parentheses, onto <I>word </I> without any intervening spaces. 
 See <B><A HREF="wninput.htm">wninput</B>(5WN)</A>
 for a list of the syntactic markers for adjectives. </DD>

<DT><I>lex_id</I> 
 </DT>
<DD>One digit hexadecimal integer that, when appended onto <I>lemma </I>, uniquely 
identifies a sense within a lexicographer file.  <I>lex_id </I> numbers usually 
start with <B>0 </B>, and are incremented as additional senses of the word are 
added to the same file, although there is no requirement that the numbers 
be consecutive or begin with <B>0 </B>. Note that a value of <B>0 </B> is the default, 
and therefore is not present in lexicographer files.  </DD>

<DT><I>p_cnt</I>  </DT>
<DD>Three digit 
decimal integer indicating the number of pointers from this synset to 
other synsets.  If <I>p_cnt </I> is <B>000 </B> the synset has no pointers. </DD>

<DT><I>ptr</I>  </DT>
<DD>A pointer 
from this synset to another.  <I>ptr </I> is of the form: 
<P><blockquote>
 <I>pointer_symbol<tt> </tt>synset_offset<tt> </tt>pos<tt> </tt>source/target 
</I> </blockquote>
 <P>
 where <I>synset_offset </I> is the byte offset of the target synset in the 
data file corresponding to <I>pos </I>. <P>
 The <I>source/target </I> field distinguishes 
lexical and semantic pointers.  It is a four byte hexadecimal field: the 
first two bytes indicate the word number in the current (source) synset, 
the last two bytes indicate the word number in the target synset.  A value 
of <B>0000 </B> means that <I>pointer_symbol </I> represents a semantic relation between 
the current (source) synset and the target synset indicated by <I>synset_offset 
</I>. <P>
 A lexical relation between two words in different synsets is represented 
by non-zero values in the source and target word numbers. The first and 
last two bytes of this field indicate the word numbers in the source and 
target synsets, respectively, between which the relation holds.  Word numbers 
are assigned to the <I>word </I> fields in a synset, from left to right, beginning 
with <B>1 </B>. <P>
 See  <B><A HREF="wninput.htm">wninput</B>(5WN)</A>
 for a list of <I>pointer_symbol </I>s, and semantic 
and lexical pointer classifications. </dd>

<DT><I>frames</I>  </DT>
<DD>In <B>data.verb </B> only, a list 
of numbers corresponding to the generic verb sentence frames for <I>word 
</I>s in the synset.   <I>frames </I> is of the form: </DD>
<P>
 <I>f_cnt</i><tt> </tt><B>+</b><I><tt> </tt>f_num<tt> </tt>w_num</i><tt> </tt>[<B>+</b><I><tt> </tt>f_num<tt> </tt>w_num...] </I> <BR>
 <P>
 where <I>f_cnt </I> a two digit decimal integer indicating the number of generic 
frames listed, <I>f_num </I> is a two digit decimal integer frame number, and 
<I>w_num </I> is a two digit hexadecimal number indicating the word in the synset 
that the frame applies to.  As with pointers, if this number is <B>00 </B>, <I>f_num 
</I> applies to all <I>word </I>s in the synset.  If non-zero, it is applicable only 
to the word indicated.  Word numbers are assigned as described for pointers. 
Each <I>f_num w_num </I> pair is preceded by a <B>+ </B>. See <B><A HREF="wninput.htm">wninput</B>(5WN)</A>
 for the text 
of the generic sentence frames. </dd>

<DT><I>gloss</I>  </DT>
<DD>Each synset contains a gloss.  A 
<I>gloss </I> is represented as a vertical bar (<B>| </B>), followed by a text string 
that continues until the end of the line.  The gloss may contain a definition, 
one or more example sentences, or both. </DD>
</DL>
 
<H3><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4">Sense Numbers </A></H3>
Senses in WordNet 
are generally ordered from most to least frequently used, with the most 
common sense numbered <B>1 </B>.  Frequency of use is determined by the number 
of times a sense is tagged in the various semantic concordance texts.  
Senses that are not semantically tagged follow the ordered senses.  The 
<I>tagsense_cnt </I> field for each entry in the <B>index.<I>pos </I></B> files indicates how 
many of the senses in the list have been tagged. <P>
 The  <B><A HREF="cntlist.htm">cntlist</B>(5WN)</A>
 file 
provided with the database lists the number of times each sense is tagged 
in the semantic concordances.  The data from <B>cntlist </B> is used by <B><A HREF="grind.htm">grind</B>(1WN)</A>
 
to order the senses of each word.  When the <B>index </B>.<I>pos </I> files are generated, 
the <I>synset_offset </I>s are output in sense number order, with sense 1 first 
in the list.  Senses with the same number of semantic tags are assigned 
unique but consecutive sense numbers.  The WordNet  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>OVERVIEW </B></FONT>
  search displays 
all senses of the specified word, in all syntactic categories, and indicates 
which of the senses are represented in the semantically tagged texts.  

<H3><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5">Exception List File Format </A></H3>
Exception lists are alphabetized lists of inflected 
forms of words and their base forms.  The first field of each line is an 
inflected form, followed by a space separated list of one or more base 
forms of the word.  There is one exception list file for each syntactic 
category. <P>
 Note that the noun and verb exception lists were automatically 
generated from a machine-readable dictionary, and contain many words that 
are not in WordNet.  Also, for many of the inflected forms, base forms 
could be easily derived using the standard rules of detachment programmed 
into Morphy (See <B><A HREF="morph.htm">morph</B>(7WN)</A>
). These anomalies are allowed to remain in 
the exception list files, as they do no harm.  
<H3><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6">Format of Sense Grouping 
Files </A></H3>
In all syntactic categories the synsets containing a search word 
can be displayed in sense number order.  For nouns and verbs, the <FONT SIZE=-1><B>RELATIVES 
</B></FONT>
  search displays similar senses of a word together. <P>
 Two files are used 
by the grouping algorithm of the WordNet search code.  <B>cousin.tops </B> is a 
list of pairs of <I>synset_offset </I>s, one pair per line, each representing 
a set of top nodes for the noun cousin grouping relation. <P>
 Candidates for 
cousin grouping are checked by hand and those that would normally be grouped 
by the grouping heuristics, but are really not similar in meaning, are 
listed in <B>cousin.exc </B>.  Each line contains at least two space separated 
<I>synset_offset </I>s, with the one of lower numerical value coming first.  If 
additional offsets are present, they are all of greater numerical value 
than the first field. Offsets occurring on the same line represent synsets 
containing different senses of a word that should not be grouped together. 
<P>
 See <B><A HREF="wngroups.htm">wngroups</B>(7WN)</A>
 for more information on how noun and verb senses are 
grouped.  
<H3><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7">Verb Example Sentences </A></H3>
For some verb senses, example sentences 
illustrating the use of the verb sense can be displayed.  Each line of 
the file <B>sentidx.vrb </B> contains a <I>sense_key </I> followed by a space and a comma 
separated list of example sentence template numbers, in decimal.  The file 
<B>sents.vrb </B> lists all of the example sentence templates.  Each line begins 
with the template number followed by a space.  The rest of the line is 
the text of a template example sentence, with <B>%s </B> used as a placeholder 
in the text for the verb.  Both files are sorted alphabetically so that 
the <I>sense_key </I> and template sentence number can be used as indices, via 
<B><A HREF="binsrch.htm">binsrch</B>(3WN)</A>
,<B></B> into the appropriate file. <P>
 When a request for  <FONT SIZE=-1><B>FRAMES </B></FONT>
  
is made, the WordNet search code looks for the sense in <B>sentidx.vrb </B>.  If 
found, the sentence template(s) listed is retrieved from <B>sents.vrb </B>, and 
the <B>%s </B> is replaced with the verb.  If the sense is not found, the applicable 
generic sentence frame(s) listed in <I>frames </I> is displayed.  
<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#toc8">NOTES </A></H2>
Information 
in the <B>data.<I>pos </I></B> and <B>index.<I>pos </I></B> files represents all of the word senses 
and synsets in the WordNet database. The <I>word </I>, <I>lex_id </I>, and <I>lex_filenum 
</I> fields together uniquely identify each word sense in WordNet.  These can 
be encoded in a <I>sense_key </I> as described in <B><A HREF="senseidx.htm">senseidx</B>(5WN)</A>
. Each synset in 
the database can be uniquely identified by combining the <I>synset_offset 
</I> for the synset with a code for the syntactic category (since it is possible 
for synsets in different <B>data.<I>pos </I></B> files to have the same <I>synset_offset 
</I>). <P>
 The WordNet system provide both command line and window-based browser 
interfaces to the database.  Both interfaces utilize a common library of 
search and morphology code.  The source code for the library and interfaces 
is included in the WordNet package.  See <B><A HREF="wnintro.htm">wnintro</B>(3WN)</A>
 for an overview of 
the WordNet source code.
