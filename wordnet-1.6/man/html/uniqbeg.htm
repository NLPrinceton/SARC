uniqbeg - unique beginners for noun hierarchies  
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#toc1">DESCRIPTION </A></H2>
All 
of the WordNet noun synsets are organized into hierarchies.  Each synset 
is part of at least one hierarchy, headed by a synset called a unique 
beginner.  All of these synsets originate in the lexicographer file <B>noun.Tops 
</B>.  From any noun synset, except a unique beginner, the hypernym pointers 
can be traced up to one of the following synsets: <P>
  <blockquote>{ entity, something, 
(anything having existence (living or nonliving)) }  <BR>
 <P>
 { psychological_feature, 
(a feature of the mental life of a living organism) } <BR>
 <P>
 { abstraction, 
(a general concept formed by extracting common features from specific 
examples) } <BR>
 <P>
 { state, (the way something is with respect to its main 
attributes; "the current state of knowledge";  <BR>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;"his state of health"; 
"in a weak financial state") } <BR>
 <P>
 { event, (something that happens at a 
given place and time) } <BR>
 <P>
 { act, human_action, human_activity, (something 
that people do or cause to happen) } <BR>
 <P>
 { group, grouping, (any number 
of entities (members) considered as a unit) } <BR>
 <P>
 { possession, (anything 
owned or possessed) } <BR>
 <P>
 { phenomenon, (any state or process known through 
the senses rather than by intuition or reasoning) } <BR>
