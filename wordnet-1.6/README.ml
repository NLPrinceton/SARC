		******* WordNet users' mailing list **********

We have a WordNet users' mailing list that is administered here at
Princeton.  Items addressed to the mailing list will be automatically
forwarded to all users on the list.  Please note that this mailing
list is separate from the user database.  In order to participate in
the mailing list, you must specifically request to be added.  We hope
that the mailing list will be a place for useful discourse about
WordNet to take place.  We at Princeton are always interested to hear
what our users are doing with WordNet, and we imagine many users
wonder what others are using it for.  Hopefully this mailing list will
help to bring researchers together to exchange their ideas,
experiences, code and philosophies.

To post a message to the mailing list, address mail to
'wn-users@princeton.edu'.  Requests to be added to or removed from the
mailing list should be sent to 'wn-users-request@princeton.edu'.
Please be sure to include your correct e-mail address in the body of
your request.  Also, to help us keep our records up to date, if you
are a current WordNet user it would be helpful to us if you would
include the version of WordNet you are using (the latest release is
1.6) and the platform(s) that you are running on.

If you have code or various flavors of the WordNet database that you
would like to share with others you can announce to the mailing list.
We are willing to set up a "contrib" directory on our FTP site for
user submitted programs.  Please send email to 'wordnet@princeton.edu'
if you have a package to contribute.

To help with the administrative end of things, items sent to
'wn-users-request@princeton.edu' should use the 'Subject' of the
message to convey the intent of the request.  To be added to the
mailing list, please specify a subject of 'Add user'.  Similarly, to
be removed from the list, specify a subject of 'Remove user'.

PS.  Administrative requests may only be handled once a week so please
be patient.
