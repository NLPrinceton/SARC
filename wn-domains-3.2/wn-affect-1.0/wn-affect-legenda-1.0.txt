"Emotion" synsets are the only pure emotional synset: they refer directly
to emotional states/processes.

From theories of emotions we have that moods have to be distincted from
emotions. Therefore, "mood" synset are affective but not emotional one. 

Personality traits influence attitude to have affective reations to events,
then "traits" synsets have an indirect reference to the affective states.

Affective states are often confused with cognitive ones because they
have a mutual strict relation. "cognitive state" synsets represent
cognitive states that are often related to affect but form a
distincted category.

Similar considerations have to be made for "physical state" synsets.

Edonic signals (pleasure and pain) are a necessary component of
affective state but they are not emotions itself. We consider "edonic
signal" synsets in order to consider these concepts.

Emotional states have causes and consequences. The causes are named
"eliciting-emotion situations" and may be events, behaviours etc
(e.g. a "dangerous situations" may cause fear). The consequences of
emotions are named "emotional responses", and may consist in
beaviours, somatic changes, facial expressions etc. The "emotional
response" synsets represent that set of responces.

"Behaviour" synsets represents behaviour that are either cause or
effect of affective states.

"Attitude" synsets refer to "attitudes", that are complex mental state
involving beliefs, feelings, values, and dispositions to act in
certain ways.

A "sensation" is an unelaborated elementary awareness of
stimulation. "Sensation" synset represent that kind of concepts.

The following are used to identify affective synsets of the WordNet-Affect
"core" and those generated by some WordNet relations (symilarity, antonymy,
derived-from, also-see, attribute):

core = synsets manually identified

similar-to = synset obtained by "similar-to" relation

antonym = synset obtained by "antonym" relation

derived-from = synset obtained by "derived-from" relation

also-see =synset obtained by "also-see" relation

attribute = synset obtained by "attribute" relation

is-value-of = synset obtained by "is-value-of" relation
